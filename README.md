##Introduction##





The Morse Code Beacon project uses an Arduino to transmit messages via Morse code using an LED or buzzer. This project is ideal for learning the basics of electronics, communication systems, and programming. You can transmit predefined messages in Morse code, which consists of a series of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). The project offers flexibility for customization and is perfect for educational or signaling purposes.

Features
Transmits Morse code messages with LED or buzzer.
Customizable message and timing for dots, dashes, and pauses.
Expandable with additional components (e.g., buttons, displays).
Components Required
Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
LED (or buzzer)
220Ω Resistor (for LED)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
USB Cable
Computer with Arduino IDE
Circuit Diagram
LED Connection:

Connect the positive leg of the LED to a digital pin (e.g., Pin 13) via a 220Ω resistor.
Connect the negative leg of the LED to GND.
Buzzer (Optional):

Connect the positive leg of the buzzer to a digital pin, and the negative leg to GND.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/morse-code-beacon.git
Open the project in the Arduino IDE.
Connect your Arduino to your computer.
Upload the code to the Arduino.
Usage
Set up the circuit as per the Circuit Diagram.
Upload the code to the Arduino.
The LED (or buzzer) will transmit the default Morse code message ("SOS").
Add buttons to input custom messages.
Implement an LCD display to show the current message.
