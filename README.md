# Morse Code Beacon

## Introduction
The Morse Code Beacon is to transmit messages via Morse code using an LED or buzzer. One can transmit predefined messages in Morse code, which consists of a series of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals).
The project offers flexibility for customization and is perfect for educational or signaling purposes.

## Features
Transmits Morse code messages with LED or buzzer.
Customizable message and timing for dots, dashes, and pauses.

## Components Required
Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
LED (or buzzer)
220Ω Resistor (for LED)
Breadboard
Jumper wires
USB Cable
Computer with Arduino IDE
Circuit Diagram
LED Connection:

## Steps
Connect the positive leg of the LED to a digital pin (e.g., Pin 13) via a 220Ω resistor.
Connect the negative leg of the LED to GND.
Connect the positive leg of the buzzer to a digital pin, and the negative leg to GND.
The LED (or buzzer) will transmit the default Morse code message ("SOS").
Add buttons to input custom messages.
Implement an LCD display to show the current message.
